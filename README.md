Java tutorials, Coding Challenges and Problems


This project contains some simple java snippets, taken from codingbat.com

I've used this as a self-teaching/test to learn and refresh java basics while forcing myself to get into the habit of writing the unit tests first


CodingBat 
----------
Solutions to problems provided in codingBat site (http://codingbat.com/)
Part of completing these problems I'm trying to get used to TDD by creating the tests first and then performing the code elements - hopefully this gets me into the habit of doing this without thinking much in future.

git
----
As an extra bit of leaning, I'm using git to manage this project - therefore hopefully helping me get to grips with git at the same time.. who said men can't multi-task!! (go me!)
